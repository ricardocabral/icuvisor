### Step 1: Add fields to client write struct + payload
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Verify read-side wellness JSON tags for `spO2`, `vo2max`, `abdomen`, `respiration`, and `menstrualPhase`.
- [x] Add missing fields to `WriteWellnessParams`.
- [x] Extend `writeWellnessBody` to include the new sparse payload keys.

### Step 2: Expose fields in the tool
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Extend `updateWellnessRequest` with the five new fields.
- [x] Extend `updateWellnessInputSchema` with documented properties for the new fields.
- [x] Add handler validation for numeric ranges and non-empty `menstrualPhase`.
- [x] Map the new request fields into `WriteWellnessParams`.
- [x] Include the new fields in the `fields_updated` echo.

### Step 3: Tests
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Add table-driven coverage for each new field asserting outbound body keys, `fields_updated`, and validation failures.
- [x] Add a combined-fields test that writes all five new fields at once.

### Step 4: Build, lint, manual smoke
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Run `make build`, `make test`, `make test-race`, and `make lint` successfully.
- [x] Decide and document whether the optional `.env-dev` manual smoke was run.
  - Manual smoke not run: skipped optional live `.env-dev` write to avoid mutating athlete data in this automated lane; unit/integration tests cover request schema, payload mapping, validation, and response metadata.

### Step 5: Close the GitHub issue
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased] → Fixed` with the missing `update_wellness` fields.
- [x] Update `STATUS.md` with final delivery notes.
  - Delivery notes: added five missing wellness write fields end-to-end; validation covers `spO2`, non-negative numeric fields, and non-empty `menstrualPhase`; `make build`, `make test`, `make test-race`, and `make lint` passed.
- [x] Commit final documentation/status changes with a conventional commit referencing TP-072 and #8.
- [x] Push or document why push/PR handoff and post-merge issue closure cannot be completed from this lane.
  - Pushed branch `task/jusbrasil-lane-2-20260516T174422` and opened PR https://github.com/ricardocabral/icuvisor/pull/14 with `Closes #8`; post-merge issue auto-close verification remains pending merge.
